## Changelog

__v1.1.1__

* Updated GoCardless API to v0.4.2
* Added config option "PreAuth Only". This option is mutually exclusive with "one off only", and will result in a pre-authorization agreement beign created for all payments, including one off payments. Leave unchecked to retain current operation where a pre-auth is only created for 
* Multiple changes to the _link and _capture functions to avoid erroneously sending "Credit Card Payment Failed" email alerts when a payment is still pending
